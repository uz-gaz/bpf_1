# A basic processor core unit for running BPF programs

This repository contains all source files used in my degree's final project, which consists in the development of a basic processor core unit for running eBPF programs, implementated in VHDL in order to synthesize it into a FPGA.

 - [**ebpf-core:**](./ebpf-core) Contains source code of VHDL implementation of the eBPF core, scripts for compilation and other useful files.
 - [**ebpf-assembler:**](./ebpf-assembler) Assembler made for compiling tests.
